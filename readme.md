# FBS Assignment

## Getting Started

```
bundle install
```

## Running the Examples

```
ruby listing_by_id.rb [Optional listing id]
```

This will return the listing info for either the listing id
you entered into the command line or the default listing 
hard-coded into the script.

The returned info will be written into listing.txt

```
ruby new_contact.rb
``` 

This will create a new contact record, retain the contact ID, 
retrieve the contact info from the API then print that info 
to the console

## Assignment Specs

1. Write a script that retrieves a listing by ID and saves it to a file as JSON

2. Write a script that creates a new contact record, and then prints the new contactâ€™s record (standard output is fine)
